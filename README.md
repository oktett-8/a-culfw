# Alternative culfw for cul devices
___
**The orginal fimware is cloned from www.culfw.de (thanks for the work to R.K.)**

**This alternative firmware has additional send receive methods and code cleanups.**  

_This fork is intended to upgrade the original a-culfw repository to the firmware found at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/culfw/code/commit_browser) to be used for future patches. Original purpose is the fix of nanoCUL crashes for wMBus. However, this branch contains the complete tree from r568 at SourceForge._
